# Project_4_football - Machine Learning 
Final Project for Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp

This branch is for our project file files.

We continued to build on our previous project (Branches 1-3).  We looked to predict and evaluate if team management would be happy with their results based on comparison with other teams.  Our project 1 had season summary data for 5 years we determined that an additional 5 years would be required. 

The same cdv files were created for the 10 year season summary.  Teams, Wins, Losses, Draws, Points, Possession, and wages were evaluated as part of our clustering process.  The data frame was scaled and kmeans was used to determine the number of clusters.  The Birch and Agglomerative models were also checked.

Once the clustering was complete we started the analysis using Tableau to provide visualization and also added to our app project 3.
