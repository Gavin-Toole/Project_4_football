# Project_4_football - Machine Learning 
Final Project for Data Analytics and Visualization Bootcamp

This branch is for our project file files.

We continued to build on our previous project (Branches 1-3).  We looked to predict and evaluate if team management would be happy with their results based on comparison with other teams.  Our project 1 had season summary data for 5 years we determined that an additional 5 years would be required. 

The same csv files were created for the 10 year season summary.  Teams, Wins, Losses, Draws, Points, Possession, and wages were evaluated as part of our clustering process.  The data frame was scaled and kmeans was used to determine the number of clusters.  The Birch and Agglomerative models were also checked.

Outputs from the scrapping and clustering were uploaded to SQL and Elephant SQL for transformation and deployment to our flask app and tableau for visualization. 

Various Tableau worksheets and dashboards were created to show the team clusters by league.  Several features were also plotted so Managers could evaluate where improvements would be required to improve their teams performance.
